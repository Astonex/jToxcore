/**
 * This package supplies the base classes needed for using the Tox library in java.
 * 
 * <p>The main class is {@link im.tox.jtoxcore.JTox}, which enables the creation of native tox instances, 
 * and all interaction with these.
 * 
 * <p>Note to Android developers: You should be able to create a subclass of this that implements
 * the Parcelable interface, so you can pass JTox instances around between different Activities.
