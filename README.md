jToxcore
========

JNI wrapper for Toxcore


Currently, it should be possible to simply import the project into Eclipse. 
The CDT tools for Eclipse are needed, and can be installed via this http://download.eclipse.org/tools/cdt/releases/kepler/ update-site.
This is for the most recent version of Eclipse (Kepler)

The project assumes make is available. I don't know the include paths that will be automatically set up when freshly importing this,
so direct any questions on importing this to https://github.com/sonOfRa. Also sonOfRa on IRC in both #tox and #tox-dev.
